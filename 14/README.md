"Whats the social tree / and the dancing tree / and the tree that is nearest the sea / The dandiest tree / and the kissable tree / and the tree where ships may be . . . ."
This poem was published on several occasions with slight variations including a lengthy version in the May 10, 1890 issue of Good Housekeeping. Each line of the poem is a kind of puzzle: the answer to the first line is 'Pear' or 'Tea' (as in a pair are enough for society, and tea is often served at social events); the answer to the second line is 'Hop.'
