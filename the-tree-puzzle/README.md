# The Tree Puzzle

This poem was published on several occasions with slight variations including a lengthy version in the May 10, 1890 issue of Good Housekeeping. Each line of the poem is a kind of puzzle: the answer to the first line is 'Pear' or 'Tea' (as in a pair are enough for society, and tea is often served at social events); the answer to the second line is 'Hop.'

February 4th 1902<br>
Miss Jenkins<br><br>

Whats the social tree<br>
And the dancing tree<br>
And the tree that is nearest the sea<br>
The dandiest tree<br>
And the kissable tree<br>
And the tree where ships may be<br>
Whats the tell tale tree<br>
And the traitors tree<br>
And the tree that is warmest clad<br>
The languishing tree<br>
The chronologist tree<br>
And the tree that makes one sad<br>
The most yielding tree<br>
The Egyptian plaque tree<br>
The tree that bears a curse<br>
The reddish brown tree<br>
The reddish blue tree<br>
and the tree like an Irish nurse
