A yellow oasis in hell = premeditated stupidity = A phrenological idol. The sombre dream of the grey-eyed Corsican A Brain so small that an animacuale went to view it with a compound Microscope The wrestling of shadows, a square chunk of carrion with two green eyes held by threads of gossamer which floats at midnight in bleak old rural graveyards. Three million miles beyond the limits of the universe where the anglels dare not go There flies forever from nihil to nihil the foulest demon of the Cosmos.
