[Miss Quay](https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/346214006410136-thomas-edison-signed-and-handwritten-poem-miss-quay)

February 4th 1902
Miss Jenkins

Whats the social tree
And the dancing tree
And the tree that is nearest the sea
The dandiest tree
And the kissable tree
And the tree where ships may be
Whats the tell tale tree
And the traitors tree
And the tree that is warmest clad
The languishing tree
The chronologist tree
And the tree that makes one sad
The most yielding tree
The Egyptian plaque tree
The tree that bears a curse
The reddish brown tree
The reddish blue tree
and the tree like an Irish nurse
