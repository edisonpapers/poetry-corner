a Boulevard St Antoine that damnable merchants of inhumanity Citenian wharfrats. Why Centenus dost run a line already greased from Sirus to Capella with angularity, whereonb ten millionc devils slide down to the farthermost sag and piss into pendemonum Tell me winged soldier of Hellc oif in the farthermost ends of infinity warted demons with cavernous mouths spit saliva on the balls of [-----]d the firmament to produce deluges, hast seen the Juif errant he mocks destru the angel of destruction, amuses himself by letting off fire works in powder mills. Citronella this damnd perfume on the Vine Clad Hills of Andulusia8 wafted as from a garden filled with Red hat giraffes a Rain of Boullion<br><br>

Soup descended on the thirsty soil and the wells and [--]d snake holes puked from the miasmatic water from the richness of the rapast, prithee tells usb Centenus, we of the finite minds, if Vesuvius constipated from derangement of the terranianc kidneys will ever vomit up again to engulf the moreb Earthlice They tell me the milky way is formed of stars & planets so innumerable & its diameter so great that [iff ?]d if Adam was one and all the sands of the sea were cyphers they would not express a preceptible segment of the grand ring— Doth god have a pegasus & use the milky way as a hitching ring - <br>

Whizzozririzing an asteroid has run plump into a favorite angel. This Crank<br>

lump of matter will be used for [-------------]d water closets in Hadese two angels at a candy pull, they streatch the viscous molasses from Vega to Acturus at every pull, flies as big as Japan buzzed around it.<br>

A Bowery angel smoking a palm tree stubbed his toe on a comet,c and pimples came out on his toe nail as big as a mountains, he swore so much that God made eight new planets out of the conversation & peopled and fauna’dc & flora’dc them eccentrically The almighty has a vein of humor he made these planets & peopled them<br><br><br>

to give amusements to beings on the rest of the celestial plantation. The men were 800 miles long & 1/4 inch thick they slept on telegraph poles, and animals with bodies as big as a pea with 900c eyes each as big as a saucer lived on these long men by catching them by the feet & sucking them in like maccaronif<br><br>

In the most charming nook in Paradise amid surroundings more beautiful than areb imaginatively conceivable, in a palace dwell Gabreal & Evangeline,9 each endowed with a capacity capable of enjoying that which DeQuincy,10c had he a brain 300 miles in diameter full of opium would never imagine—

A yellow oasis in hell =<br>
premeditated stupidity = A phrenological idol.<br>
The sombre dream of the grey-eyed Corsican<br>
A Brain so small that an animacuale went to view it<br>
with a compound Microscope The wrestling of<br>
shadows, a square chunk of carrion with two green<br>
eyes held by threads of gossamer which floats at <br>
midnight in bleak old rural graveyards.<br>
Three million miles beyond the limits of the<br>
universe where the anglels dare not go<br>
There flies forever from nihil to nihil the foulest<br>
demon of the Cosmos.

## Ms. Quay

This poem was published on several occasions with slight variations including a lengthy version in the May 10, 1890 issue of Good Housekeeping. Each line of the poem is a kind of puzzle: the answer to the first line is 'Pear' or 'Tea' (as in a pair are enough for society, and tea is often served at social events); the answer to the second line is 'Hop.'

Miss Jenkins<br><br>

Whats the social tree<br>
And the dancing tree<br>
And the tree that is nearest the sea<br>
The dandiest tree<br>
And the kissable tree<br>
And the tree where ships may be<br>
Whats the tell tale tree<br>
And the traitors tree<br>
And the tree that is warmest clad<br>
The languishing tree<br>
The chronologist tree<br>
And the tree that makes one sad<br>
The most yielding tree<br>
The Egyptian plaque tree<br>
The tree that bears a curse<br>
The reddish brown tree<br>
The reddish blue tree<br>
and the tree like an Irish nurse
